## üßê What?
"Get over Toilet Paper" is short for "**Seriously think about a paperless world? Time to get over toilet paper!**", an interactive inforgraphics that aims to educate viewers about the toilet paper. with the ultimate message that "we should not overconsume toilet paper and think about better substitutes for the environment in the long term.

## ü§∑ Why?  
Inspired by the so-called "Toilet Paper Shortages" during the Covid era, specifically in 2020 and 2021, in different regions of the world, I decide to dedicate one interactive inforgraphics to this topic. 

In the era of digitalization, you are tempted to use less paper: buy tablet for note-taking, purchase e-books for reading, and send your CV in PDF form to recruiters. Even vaccination certificates do not come in a physical form in many countries. However, there is one thing that, like most the people, you may forget to "digitize-: toilet paper. If you don't believe that humans should "get over*‚Äô toilet paper or haven't found a good reason to, this paperless infographic is for you. Or if you already get rid of it in your daily life, you can also read this to feel proud about your smart decision.

## ‚öíÔ∏è How?  
Data is agglomerated from different sources: Statista, World Bank, MSR Open Data, Scientific American, World Atlas, etc before being cleaned and processed for visualization.

The visualization is built using Tableau. The infographic follows a storyline when scrolled down. Different types of graphs, including advanced ones are shown to present the message in an creative and memorable way.


## üß± Structure?
This repository contains 3 folders:
- **data**, including:
    + raw (secondary data in their rawest formats)
    + final (the data set ready for visualization)
- **src**, including:
    + the main Tableau workbook
- **media** (media files)
  
## ‚úåÔ∏è Result?  

After finishing the project, I can see that the shortage crisis of toilet paper was not actually a bad thing. It was a sign that some of us had been unnecessarily dependent on it. By looking for more eco-friendly solutions and using toilet paper in moderation, we can solve the shortages while contributing to a sustainable future.
